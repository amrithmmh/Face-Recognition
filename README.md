# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition using KNN algorithm and open cv for python. It records your face and record the image pixels in form of a rectangle frame. When u run the face_recog.py script it compares the image pixels with stored data. This is a implementation of knn classifier.
# Breakdown of the code for knn classifier
    1. Importing libraries
    2. Create some data for classification
    3. Write the kNN workflow
    4. Finally, run knn on the data and observe results
# Accuracy
   98.4 (using knn) because of small dataset. Taking distance from webcam and quality of light into consideration it would give 90+          accuracy.
